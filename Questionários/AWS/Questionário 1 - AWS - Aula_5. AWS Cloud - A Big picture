A) Load Balancer
B) DNS Service
C) CDN
D) NoSQL Database

12. Why are relational databases considered difficult to scale horizontally?
A) Because they do not support SQL.
B) Because they have state (data) which is hard to distribute.
C) Because they are too expensive.
D) Because they only run on one operating system.

13. What strategy is mentioned to reduce the load on a relational database?
A) Introduce a database cache.
B) Use a larger hard drive.

16. Where should media files (videos, images) generally be stored in a scalable cloud architecture?
A) Directly on the application server's disk.
B) In the Relational Database.
C) In External Storage.
D) In the Load Balancer.

17. What is a key benefit of using External Storage for media files?

A) Vertical Scaling
B) CDN (Content Delivery Network)
C) Larger Database
D) Better Codec Programs

19. How does a CDN (Content Delivery Network) improve user experience?
A) By caching content in locations geographically closer to the user.
B) By increasing the size of the original server.
C) By compressing the video files to a smaller size.
